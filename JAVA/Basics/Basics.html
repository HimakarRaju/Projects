                <li>Java is a high-level, general-purpose programming language developed by a small team</li>
                <li>headed by James Gosling and Patrick Naughton at Sun Microsystems in 1991.</li>
                <li>It is currently owned by Oracle Corporation.</li>
                <li>It was designed to be small, simple, and portable across platforms and operating systems.</li>
                <li>It was initially developed for consumer devices.</li>
                <li>Later it has become a popular platform to develop enterprise applications.</li>
                <li>Java 16 is the latest version of Java as of  March 2021. </li>

            <p>Java comes in various editions to cater to various types of application development needs.</p>
            Two key editions of Java are:
                <li>Java Standard Edition</li>
                <li>Java Enterprise Edition</li>

            To learn Java programming fundamentals, we need Java SE.

                <li>Java SE (Standard Edition)</li>

            This edition consists of libraries for building core Java applications.

                <li>Java EE (Enterprise Edition)</li>

            This edition consists of libraries for building distributed Java applications. These libraries depend on Java SE libraries.
